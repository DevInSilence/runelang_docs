## Interduction

This is a book about building a programming language. While the concepts covered here are applicable to any language, the code examples provided are in Rust. This is because the code generation library we will be using is in Rust. However, feel free to use the language of your choice and apply the concepts discussed in this book.

Fun Fact: I have to work on the language but I can't stop writing this book. I hope you enjoy it.

## How does this book work?

After attempting various approaches and starting multiple language projects, I have never been able to successfully complete a language. However, this journey has provided me with valuable knowledge and experience. This book serves as a platform for documenting and sharing everything I have learned. While I may not be a professional, I believe that by writing this book, I can assist both others and myself. As I write this book, I am also learning and improving. My hope is that you will find this book helpful in building your own language.

## Who is this book for?

I aim to strike a balance between simplicity and complexity in this book. It is intended for individuals who already have programming knowledge and experience in their chosen language. Additionally, I make an effort to keep the book as up-to-date as possible. For example, if a particular library undergoes an update, I will strive to update the book accordingly.

## Plan

This book is divided into multiple parts that cover essential topics. It's important to note that certain topics may require modifications to previous parts. For instance, when we introduce functions, we may need to make changes to the lexer to support the necessary lexicals.

- **Basics**:
  - [Language components](basics/language-components.md)
  - [Runelang-Language Design](basics/Runelang-language-design.md)
  - [Environment setup](basics/environment-setup.md)
  - [Project setup](basics/project-setup.md)
- **Rune-Core**:
  - [Core introduction](rune-core/core-introduction.md)

## Source Code

All the code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/DevInSilence/Runelang) look under branches and tags for the code at different stages.
