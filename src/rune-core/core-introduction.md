## Core Introduction

To build the core of our project, we need to establish a solid foundation by implementing essential components. We will start by setting up a basic lexer, followed by writing unit tests to ensure its functionality. Once basic lexing is functional, we'll proceed to develop the parser. The parser will be gradually expanded by implementing one expression or statement at a time.

## Roadmap

1. **setup-lexer**: We will set up the lexer and write unit tests to ensure its functionality.
2. **error-handling**: We will create the basics for error handling. We might need to adjust it later on.
